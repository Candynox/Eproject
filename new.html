      <p class="text-information2">In a short span of six months, ViewSonic partnered with 16 of the 22 local education departments of municipalities, counties, 
         and cities to set up 20 training bases and to cultivate more than 2,000 certified lecturers. In addition to hosting more than 150 livestreams to assist teachers with remote teaching, 
         ViewSonic has also hosted a teaching demonstration competition. ViewSonic is announcing the results of the competition and awards today, spotlighting new forms of education in the post-pandemic era.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-information2">“As part of our commitment to transforming education, ViewSonic continues to advocate all-around education technology and enhance the educational environment, 
         teacher capabilities, and curriculums. 2021 has been a challenging year as we faced a serious outbreak, which threatened to severely interrupt education. ViewSonic has always stood by teachers 
         and assisted them in handling various teaching environments, whether they be physical, online, or hybrid. We sincerely hope that the new normal of education will become the benchmark for global digital education in the post-pandemic era,” said James Chu, Chairman and CEO of ViewSonic.</p> <br>
         <h3>Rethinking education during the pandemic</h3>
      <p class="text-information2">As Taiwan dealt with a rising number of COVID-19 cases in May this year, ViewSonic immediately launched the “Learning Never Stops!” livestream courses. The livestreams were broadcasted to various regions in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In three months’ time, ViewSonic hosted more than 150 livestreams.</p>
      <p class="text-information2">To accelerate the development of digital education, ViewSonic worked closely with 16 special municipality, county, and city governments and established training bases to cultivate certified lecturers. These teachers will continue to promote digital teaching and lay a solid foundation for digital education.
         Furthermore, ViewSonic continues to improve the myViewBoard visual learning platform, providing easy-to-use teaching tools and developing the myViewBoard ecosystem. To date, almost 2,000 primary and secondary schools have joined the myViewBoard platform, and more than one-third of teachers in Taiwan—approximately 100,000 teachers—have registered to use it.</p>

      <p class="text-information2">The UWC concept of education originated with a German educator named Kurt Hahn, one of the founders of UWC. He believes that school should be a preparation for life, not just college,

         in Germany and the non-profit organization Outward Bound. In 1958, while attending a conference of NATO military envoys, he was inspired to see cooperation between members who had been adversaries during the Second World War. 
         Hahn believes that if we can together educate young people from all over the world, conflicts around the world will be prevented. From thinking about the power of education in changing the world, the UWC movement was born, with the mission 
         of making education a resource to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a stable future.</p>

         conducted by Unicef ​​in August 2020, noted that the pandemic increased stress, anxiety and depression in children. . Accordingly, social distancing activities and school closures disrupt children's lives. Boredom, 
         lack of motivation, stress, and depression appear when children have to stay in a confined space for a long time, leading to a psychological crisis.</p>

         <p class="text-information2">Specifically, activities and games at school are unified under the view that "children's voices need to be heard and respected". The curriculum is also designed to create authentic experiences for children. Specifically, 
            with a large concept, teachers will divide it into many smaller topics to equip children with knowledge and skills in many different aspects. After that, children are encouraged to participate in outdoor activities such as 
            planting seeds, playing with mud and water, painting nature... Thereby, children will actively use their senses and emotions at the same time. and imagination, developing math, science and other important skills.</p>

      <h3>Global upside down</h3>
      <p class="text-information2">These are the two most prominent phenomena occurring simultaneously in national education systems in 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which readers can easily notice by simply following the media. : closing 
         schools for home teaching and learning, teaching and learning tools and means through online platforms. Governments, especially in the OECD, have taken the following short-term measures to help the education system: equipping online learning equipment, 
         designing curriculum content and duration, equipping them insurance and sanitation, and financial assistance to the school and the student. The most positive highlight is the ability to adapt and improve pedagogy and teaching technology surprisingly 
         quickly and on a large scale. However, hidden under this surface is the reality of inequality, students in the popular or poor social group are not equipped with online tools (computers or good internet connection) nor are they cared for by their parents. , 
         encouragement should be marginalized and lead to poor academic performance. The second prominent issue concerns mental health. The ten-week detention period exposes both students and teachers to the ability to concentrate, self-control in learning, and manifestations 
         of mental instability (though varying in severity). Many countries such as France, Italy, Britain, and the United States have undergone two detentions but are still forecasted to be able to add a third detention in early 2021.</p>
         <h3>Continuing the momentum of pedagogical reform</h3>
      <p class="text-information2">From a purely pedagogical or pedagogical point of view, distance teaching and learning has only received skepticism, even opposition, from teachers, families and educational administrators for many years now. even as online platforms have blossomed. 
         In fact, the transformation of technology and digital technology into teaching tools has a whole history of it, from audio-visual devices, videos, electronic boards or most recently computers, tablets... But only in Within 3-6 months, we witness an unprecedented phenomenon 
         in the history of human education: screens (computers, smartphones) become the official pedagogical interface. Crisis is often a time to create the ability to innovate to improve shortcomings, not simply return to the "normal state" of the past.</p>
         <img class="image" src="../images/new5.jpg" alt="">
         <p class="text-information2">Education systems should continue to perfect and reform tools, means, methods, and online learning services (online platforms, broadcast media (TV/radio), paper-based take-home packages...), and It is also recommended to evaluate and compare the 
            two face-to-face (offline) and online (online) methods to the quality of teaching and learning outcomes as well as the interaction between teachers and students. This will help improve students' level of technology use and independent learning, helping generations of 
            students acquire necessary skills in life and work in the future, such as interaction and cooperation. , interdependence, reciprocity...</p>

      <h3>What is Corona Virus?</h3>
      <p class="text-information2">Corona virus is a new virus strain that has never appeared in humans, whose name comes from Latin origin. Corona virus is a virus that is covered with spikes on the outside, interacting with receptors on cells, according to a mechanism similar to keys and locks, thereby 
         allowing the virus to enter inside.</p>
      <p class="text-information2">Outbreak in late December 2019, originating in a seafood market in Hunan, Wuhan, Central China, the Corona virus was initially confirmed as a type of "strange pneumonia" or "unknown pneumonia" reason". After only 100 days of appearance, the acute respiratory infection 
         caused by the Corona virus quickly affected the economic and social fields, the financial market wobbled, the global economy fell into a recession with a high inflation rate. Unemployment and poverty are unprecedented in history..</p>
      <p class="text-information2">The name Corona virus is derived from Latin, where "corona" means "crown" or "halo". This virus has spikes on the outside, which interact with receptors on cells, in a similar way to keys and locks, thereby allowing the virus to enter inside</p>

      <h3>Symptoms of Corona virus day by day</h3>
      <p class="text-information2">Doctor Truong Huu Khanh warned: “Coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV is especially dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, children, people with weak immune systems or chronic underlying medical conditions such as: heart disease, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency, 
         obesity, diabetes... These subjects are highly infectious and difficult to treat due to rapidly evolving and life-threatening diseases. In particular, the Corona virus is extremely dangerous for pregnant women. When pregnant women get the disease, it will leave especially serious consequences. The level of 
         danger of this disease to pregnant women is similar to the level of MERS epidemic in 2014.”</p>
      <p class="text-information2">Like other strains of Corona virus MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the cause of a series of acute respiratory diseases with dangerous signs/symptoms including high fever, headache, cough, difficulty breathing and often progress to pneumonia. In severe cases, the patient also has organ failure. If not detected and treated promptly can lead to death. The incubation period is 2-10 days.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Using air filtration to remove airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial aerosols in COVID wards</h1>
      <p class="text-information2">The UK repurposed several general wards into specialized intensive care units (ICUs) during the COVID-19 pandemic when hospitals faced a lack of beds. However, these wards did not have the capacity for frequent air changes.</p>
      <p class="text-information2">Despite healthcare workers using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) with the capacity to filter medium and large size droplets, viral transmission from patients to hospital staff is commonplace—attributed to the inhalation 
         of viral particles in small (< 5µM) aerosols. Furthermore, nosocomial infections continue to plague healthcare systems; reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission can enhance safety for healthcare workers and patients.</p>
      <p class="text-information2">Studies have found that improved ventilation coupled with ultraviolet (UV) light sterilization is a better preventive measure than respiratory protective equipment. It was proposed that portable air filtration systems—capable of combining 
         high-efficiency particulate filtration and UV light sterilization—may be an achievable solution for warding off respiratory SARS-CoV-2.</p>

      <p class="text-information">Sky News reports that Richard Arnold will take over as CEO (CEO) of Ed Woodward after the 50-year-old leaves the team on December 31. It is known that Arnold has taken the position of Commercial Director at Man Utd and played a big role in the team's non-football field.</p>

      <p class="text-information">Earlier this year, Arnold made an impression when he told the AP news agency that "nobody in the world is happier than I am with the phenomenal success he is bringing" when discussing coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Now those comments are seen as a joke by the audience.</p> 
      <img class="image" src="../images/new8.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="text-information2">He was a perfect fit when the Glazers were interested and wanted to focus on making sure the Reds were a money machine. In terms of football, it is sad that Edwin van der Sar was not appointed despite the great support of the fans</p> <br>
      <p class="text-information">There is some hope that Arnold will be wiser than Ed Woodward and leave the football business to the football people.</p>
      <p class="text-information2">Woodward's low credibility came from his unwillingness to cede power to anyone else. Even director of football John Murtough has to work under him, according to information from The Telegraph. Arnold can help everyone by stepping aside, leaving</p>
